#### Dr. Kuchera's Notes:



**Data exploration:**
Really nice job. Make sure to upload a .pdf

**Model choice/exploration**
You model choice wasn't clear and I wasn't sure if you tried higher order models and why you chose the models you did (based on your data exploration).

**Code:**
Your code is well organized and easy to read. You code should live in a `src/` folder or similar so the project folder is well organized.

**REPORT:**

**Objective description**
Nice.

**Method description**
This should be a clear list of the methods used. I had a hard time matching this prose top the results presented.

**Analysis**
This section should go through all the models, hyperparameter searches, etc.

**Results**
I'm not clear on what is presented here. Are these RSS values on a test split of the datasets? Also, in the linear models, why does each feature have one answer? Linear models are often multivariate. Did you train a model with one feature each? Which are from your hand-built model and which were from `sklearn`?

**Ethics**  

You took issue with the *results* from your model, which is fair. But what about training such a model in the first place? What about using the provided data?

**Writing**  
This should not read as a play-by-play of your exploration, but rather a clear explanation of the mathods and approaches taken to achieve the results presented. 

Make sure to upload a .pdf.
